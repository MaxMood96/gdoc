NAME: Module Configuration

DESCR: Module support is available in Openlitespeed 1.3 and LSWS Enterprise 5.0 and greater.
Module files must be located in the server root/modules folder.  From there, they are loaded 
by the server application at startup. This requires that the server be restarted after the module is added.

The web admin configuration must be updated to include user-developed modules.  All modules must be added under
the server configuration tab in order to be available to the other configurations.

Server Configuration:  -> Modules tab
Click Add at the upper right of the modules table
Enter the name of the module, (as defined by MNAME), in the box next to the Module label.
Click the yes radio button to enable the module.
Add Notes and module parameters as needed.
Click yes next to the filter level that corresponds to the filter level used when 
adding the hook function in the module.
Click Save to retain the module configuration.
The priority value can be set for each filter level here in the server configuraation.  The priority for each filter level can range from -6000 to 6000, lower priority runs first.

Listener Configuration:  Select Listener from the table of listeners -> Modules tab
Click Add at the upper right of the modules table
Select the name of the module from the drop-down box next to the Module label.
Click the yes radio button to enable the module.
Add Notes and module parameters as needed.
Click yes next to the filter level that corresponds to the filter level used when 
adding the hook function in the module.  The listener filter levels are a subset of the 
server filter levels and are limited to the TCP/IP layer 4 filters.
Click Save to retain the module configuration.

Virtual Host Configuration:  Select virtual Host from the table of hosts -> Modules tab
Click Add at the upper right of the modules table
Select the name of the module from the drop-down box next to the Module label.
Click the yes radio button to enable the module.
Add Notes and module parameters as needed.
Click yes next to the filter level that corresponds to the filter level used when 
adding the hook function in the module.  The virtual host filter levels are a subset of the 
server filter levels and are limited to the HTTP connection filters.
Click Save to retain the module configuration.

Virtual Host Template Configuration:  Select virtual Host template from the table of templates -> Modules tab
Click Add at the upper right of the modules table
Select the name of the module from the drop-down box next to the Module label.
Click the yes radio button to enable the module.
Add Notes and module parameters as needed.
Click yes next to the filter level that corresponds to the filter level used when 
adding the hook function in the module.  The virtual host template filter levels are a subset of the 
server filter levels and are limited to the HTTP connection filters.
Click Save to retain the module configuration.
