[ITEM]
ID: suffix
NAME: Suffix
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR:  Specifies the script file suffixes that will be handled by this 
script handler. Suffixes must be unique. 

END_DESCR

SYNTAX: Comma delimited list with period "." character prohibited.
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: The server will automatically add a special MIME type ("application/x-httpd-[suffix]") for the first 
suffix in the list. For example, MIME type "application/x-httpd-php53" will be added 
for suffix "php53". Suffixes after the first need to set up in the {ITEM=mime} settings.

Though we list suffixes in this field, the script handlers use MIME types, not suffixes, 
to decide which scripts to handle. 

[Performance & Security] Only specify the suffixes you really need.

ID: httpdWorkers
NAME: Number of Workers
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the number of httpd workers. 

END_DESCR

SYNTAX: Integer value between 1 and 16.
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE:

TIPS: [Performance] Set an appropriate number to suit your needs. Adding more workers may not necessarily mean better performance.

ID: listenerBinding
NAME: Binding
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies which lshttpd child process the listener is assigned to. 
Different child processes can be used to handle requests to
different listeners by manually associating a listener with a
process. By default, a listener is assigned to all child processes.

[ITEM]
ID: runningAs
NAME: Running As
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 1
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the user/group that the server process runs as. This is set 
using the parameters "--with-user" and "--with-group" when running the configure 
command before installation. To reset these values, you must rerun the configure 
command and reinstall.
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: 
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: [Security] Server should not run as a privileged user such as "root". 
It is critical that the server is configured to run with a un-privileged user/group combination 
that does not have login/shell access. A user/group of {val}nobody{/} is generally a good choice.

[ITEM]
ID: maxConnections
NAME: Max Connections
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that the server can accept. 
This includes both plain TCP connections and SSL connections. Once the maximum concurrent connections limit is reached, 
the server will close Keep-Alive connections when they complete active requests. 
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: uint
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: When the server is started by "root" user, the server will try to
adjust the per-process file descriptor limits automatically, however,
if this fails, you may need to increase this limit manually.

[ITEM]
ID: disableInitLogRotation
NAME: Disable Initial Log Rotation 
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies whether to disable rotation of server error log
file at startup. Initial log rotation is enabled by default for standard installations. 

END_DESCR

[ITEM]
ID: procSoftLimit
NAME: Process Soft Limit
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Limits the total number of processes that can be created on behalf of a user. All existing processes will be counted against this limit, not just new processes to be started.

The limit can be set at the server level or at an individual external application level. The server-level limit will be used if it is not set at an individual application level. The operating system's default setting will be used if this value is 0 or absent at both levels.
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: uint
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: 
PHP scripts can call for forking processes. The main purpose of this limit is as a last line of defense to prevent fork bombs and other attacks caused by PHP processes creating other processes. 

Setting this setting too low can severely hurt functionality. The setting will thus be ignored below certain levels.

When using suEXEC Daemon mode, the actual process limit will be higher than this setting to make sure parent processes are not limited.
