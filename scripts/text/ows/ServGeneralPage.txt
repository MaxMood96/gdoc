[ITEM]
ID: suffix
NAME: Suffix
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR:  Specifies the script file suffixes that will be handled by this 
script handler. Suffixes must be unique. 

END_DESCR

SYNTAX: Comma delimited list with period "." character prohibited.
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: The server will automatically add a special MIME type ("application/x-httpd-[suffix]") for the first 
suffix in the list. For example, MIME type "application/x-httpd-php53" will be added 
for suffix "php53". Suffixes after the first need to set up in the {ITEM=mime} settings.<br>
Though we list suffixes in this field, the script handlers use MIME types, not suffixes, 
to decide which scripts to handle. <br>
 
[Performance & Security] Only specify the suffixes you really need.
