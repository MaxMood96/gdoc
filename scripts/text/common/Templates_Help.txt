template member virtual hosts and standalone virtual hosts. Inside a directory 
path configuration, this name can be referenced by the variable {val}$VH_NAME{/}.


If a standalone virtual host with the same name is also configured, then
the member virtual host configuration will be ignored.

ID: templateVHDomain
NAME: Domain
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the main domain name for this member virtual host. 
If left blank, the virtual host name will be used. This should
be a fully qualified domain name, but you can use an IP address as well. 
It is recommended to append {val}:<port>{/} for web sites not on port 80. 
For configurations containing domain names, this domain can be referenced 
with variable {val}$VH_DOMAIN{/}. 


This domain name will be used in the following situations:
<ol>
  <li>To match the hostname in the Host header when processing a
  request.</li>
  <li>To populate the domain name configurations for add-ons 
  like FrontPage or AWstats.</li>
 <li>To configure listener-to-virtual host mappings based on the virtual host template.</li>
