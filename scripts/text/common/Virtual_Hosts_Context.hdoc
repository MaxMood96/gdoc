EDITTIP: A CGI context can be used to specify a directory only contains CGI scripts. Path can be absolute path or relative to $SERVER_ROOT, $VH_ROOT 
or $DOC_ROOT(default). Path and URI must be ended with "/" for a cgi-bin directory.
END_EDITTIP

EDITTIP: If only a specific script is needed in that directory, it is recommended to create a CGI context for that script only. In this case, path and 
URI need not be a directory. For e.g., path can be ~/myapp/myscript.pl, URI can be /myapp/myscript.pl. All other files will not be served as CGI.
END_EDITTIP

SYNTAX: The path can be a directory that contains a group of CGI scripts, 
like {val}$VH_ROOT/myapp/cgi-bin/{/}. 
In this case, the context {ITEM=expuri} must end with "/", like {val}/app1/cgi/{/}.

An access control file can be placed in a directory to control the accessibility

<ul>
	<li>When nothing is checked, inherited default settings will be
	used. </li>
	<li>When {val}None{/} is checked, access control files will be
	ignored.
	</li>
	<li>When {val}Limit{/} is checked, directives "Order",
	"Allow from" and "Deny from" are allowed. </li>
	<li>When {val}Auth{/} is checked, directives
	"AuthGroupFile",  "AuthName", "AuthType", 
	"AuthUserFile", and "Require" are allowed.</li>

	"DirectoryIndex" is allowed</li>
	<li>When {val}Options{/} is checked, directive
	"Options" is allowed</li>
</ul>

Allow Override configuration is available at three levels: server, 
virtual host and context. If a configuration is not checked at the server level, 
the controlled directives will be disabled for the whole server whether or not 
it is enabled at lower levels. If something is enabled at the server level, virtual hosts will 
inherit same settings by default. Similarly context level settings will be inherited from virtual host settings. 
Lower levels can disable a setting that is enabled at an upper level, but cannot 
enable a setting that is disabled at an upper level.
END_DESCR

EDITTIP: Allow Override will be effective only if server/vhost level setting is enabled. Context will inherit virtual host settings by 
default when nothing is checked. When nothing but "None" is checked, access control file will be ignored. When "Access Control" is checked, 
directives "Order", "Allow" and "Deny" are allowed. When "Authentication" is checked, directives "AuthGroupFile", "AuthName", "AuthType", "AuthUserFile", 
"Require" are allowed.

ID: javaWebAppContext
NAME: Java Web App Context
NS: E

DESCR: Many people running Java applications use the servlet engine to serve static 
content as well. But no servlet engine is nearly as efficient as LiteSpeed Web Server for these processes. In order to improve the overall performance, 
LiteSpeed Web Server can be configured as a gateway server, which serves static content 
and forwards dynamic Java page requests to the servlet engine. 


LiteSpeed Web Server requires certain contexts to be defined in order to run a 
Java application. A Java Web App Context automatically creates all required 
contexts based on the Java web application's configuration file (WEB-INF/web.xml). 


There are a few points you need to keep in mind when setting up a Java Web App Context:

<ul>
<li>A {val}Servlet Engine{/} external application must be set up in {PAGE=ExtApp_Help} 
before Java Web App Context can be set up.<li> 
<li>A {PAGE=ScriptHandler_Help} for .jsp files should be defined as well.</li>
<li>If the web application is packed into a .war file, the .war file must be expanded. 
The server cannot access compressed archive files.</li>
<li>For the same resources, the same URL should be used no matter whether it is accessed 
through LiteSpeed Web Server or through the servlet engine's built-in HTTP server.


For example, 
  Tomcat 4.1 is installed under /opt/tomcat. Files for the "examples" web application are 
  located at /opt/tomcat/webapps/examples/. Through Tomcat's built-in HTTP server, 
  the "examples" web application is thus accessed with a URI like "/examples/***". 
  The corresponding Java Web App Context should thus be configured: 
  {ITEM=expuri} = {val}/examples/{/}, {ITEM=location} = {val}/opt/tomcat/webapps/examples/{/}.</li>
  </ul>

A web site is comprised of contexts, for example, "/" is the root Context mapped to the 
document root of a web site; "/cgi-bin/" is the context dedicated to CGI applications. 
If you think of your website as a URL tree, then every branch is a context which can be 
identified by the URL of the branching node. A context should be explicitly defined for the 
following purposes:
<ul>
  <li>To use another cluster other than the default one.</li>
