[ITEM]
ID: expuri
NAME: URI
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: {ITEM=location}

DESCR: Specifies the URI for this context. 
END_DESCR

SYNTAX:  The URI can be a plain URI (starting with "/") or 
a Perl compatible regular expression URI (starting with "exp:"). If a plain URI ends 
with a "/", then this context will include all sub-URIs under this
URI. If the context maps to a directory on the file system, a trailing "/" must be added.
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: A plain URI like {val}/examples/{/} with {ITEM=location} 
set to {val}/home/john/web_examples{/} will map the request "/examples/foo/bar.html" 
to file "/home/john/web_examples/foo/bar.html". <br>
To simulate Apache's mod_userdir, 
set URI to {val}exp: ^/~([A-Za-z0-9]+)(.*){/}, 
set {ITEM=location} to {val}/home/$1/public_html$2{/}. With these settings, a request of URI /~john/foo/bar.html will 
map to file /home/john/public_html/foo/bar.html.

[ITEM]
ID: location
NAME: Root
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: {ITEM=expuri}

DESCR: Specifies the corresponding location of this context in the file system. 
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: It can be an absolute path or path relative to $SERVER_ROOT, $VH_ROOT, or $DOC_ROOT. 
$DOC_ROOT is the default relative path, and can be omitted.<br>
If the {ITEM=expuri} is a regular expression, then the matched sub-string 
can be used to form the "Root" string. The matched sub-string can be 
referenced with the values "$1" - "$9". "$0" and "&" can be used to reference the 
whole matched string. Additionally, a query string can be set by 
appending a "?" followed by the query string. Be careful. "&" should
be escaped as "\&" in the query string.
