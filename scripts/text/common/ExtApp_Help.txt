[ITEM]
ID: extAppType
NAME: Type
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the type of external application. Application types 
are differentiated by the service they provide or the protocol they 
use to communicate with the server. Choose from
<ul>
<li>{val}FastCGI{/}: a FastCGI application with a {val}Responder{/}
role.</li>
<li>{val}FastCGI Authorizer{/}: a FastCGI application with an
{val}Authorizer{/} role</li>
<li>{val}Servlet Engine{/}: a servlet engine with an AJPv13 connector,
such as Tomcat.</li>
<li>{val}Web Server{/}: a web server or application server that
supports HTTP protocol.</li>
<li>{val}LiteSpeed SAPI App{/}: an application that communicates with the web server
using LSAPI protocol.</li>
<li>{val}Load Balancer{/}: a virtual application that can balance load
among worker applications.</li>
<li>{val}Piped Logger{/}: an application that can process access log
entries received on its STDIN stream.</li>
</ul>
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: select
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: Most applications will use either LSAPI or FastCGI protocol. 
LSAPI supports PHP, Ruby, and Python. Perl can be used with FastCGI. 
(PHP, Ruby, and Python can also be set up to run using FastCGI, but 
they run faster using LSAPI.) Java uses servlet engines.

[ITEM]
ID: extAppAddress
NAME: Address
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: A unique socket address used by the external application. 
IPv4/IPv6 sockets and Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) are supported. 
IPv4/IPv6 sockets can be used for communication over the network.  
UDS can only be used when the external application resides on the same machine as the server.
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: IPv4 or IPV6 address:port or UDS://path
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 127.0.0.1:5434

UDS://tmp/lshttpd/php.sock.
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: [Security] If the external application runs on the same machine, 
UDS is preferred. If you have to use an IPv4|IPV6 socket, 
set the IP address to {val}localhost{/} or {val}127.0.0.1{/}, 
so the external application is inaccessible from other machines. 

[Performance] Unix Domain Sockets generally provide higher performance than IPv4 sockets.

ID: expWSAddress
NAME: Address
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: HTTP or HTTPS address used by the external web server. 
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: IPv4 or IPV6 address(:port). Add "https://" in front if the external web server uses https. Port is optional if the external web server uses the standard ports 80 or 443. 
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 192.168.0.10 

127.0.0.1:5434

https://10.0.8.9

https://127.0.0.1:5438
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: [Security] If you proxy to another web server running on the same machine,  
set the IP address to {val}localhost{/} or {val}127.0.0.1{/}, 
so the external application is inaccessible from other machines.

[ITEM]
ID: maxConns
NAME: Max Connections
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established 
between the {ws_lb} and an external application. This setting controls how 
many requests can be processed concurrently by an external application,  
however, the real limit also depends on the external application itself. 
Setting this value higher will not help if the external application is not fast enough
or cannot scale to a large number of concurrent requests.
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: uint
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: [Performance] Setting a high value does not directly translate to higher performance. 
Setting the limit to a value that will not overload the external 
application will provide the best performance/throughput.

[ITEM]
ID: initTimeout
NAME: Initial Request Timeout
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum time in seconds the {ws_lb} will wait for the external 
application to respond to the first request over a new established connection. 
If the {ws_lb} does not receive any data from the external application
within this timeout limit, it will mark this connection as bad. This
helps to identify communication problems with external applications as
quickly as possible. If some requests take longer to 
process, increase this limit to avoid 503 error messages.

NAME: Persistent Connection
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies whether to keep the connection open after a request
has been processed. Persistent connections can increase performance, 
but some FastCGI external applications do not support persistent connections 
fully. The default is "On".

[ITEM]
ID: extMaxIdleTime
NAME: Max Idle Time
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum idle time before an external application
is stopped by the server. When set to "-1", the external application
will not be stopped by the server. The default value is "-1". This feature
allows resources used by idle applications to be freed. It is
especially useful in the mass hosting environment when you need to define
many applications running in "setuid" mode for the sake of maximum
security. 
END_DESCR

SYNTAX: bool
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: [Performance] This feature is especially useful in the mass hosting environment. 
In order to prevent files owned by one virtual host from being accessed by the 
external application scripts of another virtual host, mass hosting often requires 
many different applications running at the same time in SetUID mode. Set this Max 
Idle Time low to prevent these external applications from idling unnecessarily.

ID: instances
NAME: Instances
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum instances of the external application the server will
create. It is required if {ITEM=autoStart} is
enabled. Most FastCGI/LSAPI applications can only process one request
per process instance and for those types of applications, instances should
be set to match the value of {ITEM=maxConns}. Some FastCGI/LSAPI applications can 
spawn multiple child processes to handle multiple requests concurrently. 
For these types of applications, instances should be set to "1" and  
environment variables used to control how many child processes the application can spawn.

up. Only applicable to external applications that can manage their own child processes and where 
{ITEM=instances} value is set to "1".
