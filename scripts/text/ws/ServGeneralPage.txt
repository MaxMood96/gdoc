REQUIRED:

TIPS: [Security] Server should not run as a privileged user such as "root". 
It is critical that the server is configured to run with a un-privileged user/group combination 
that does not have login/shell access. A user/group of {val}nobody{/} is generally a good choice.

ID: maxConnections
NAME: Max Connections
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that the server can accept. 
This includes both plain TCP connections and SSL connections. This setting should not be set to exceed 
the hard limit set by the server software edition or license: {val}150{/} for Standard Edition, {val}500{/} 
for VPS license, {val}600{/} for Ultra VPS license. Once the maximum concurrent connections limit is reached, 
the server will close Keep-Alive connections when they complete active requests.

TIPS: When the server is started by "root" user, the server will try to
adjust the per-process file descriptor limits automatically, however,
if this fails, you may need to increase this limit manually.

[ITEM]
ID: autoReloadApacheConf
NAME: Auto Reload On Changes
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: {ITEM=apacheBinPath}

DESCR: Specifies how to apply Apache configuration changes. When set to "Yes",
LSWS will perform a graceful restart whenever the Apache configuration file
has been modified. This may cause LSWS to restart multiple times when
updating Apache configurations. A better solution (introduced in version 3.3.8)
 is "Use Apache binary wrapper". This will replace Apache httpd binary
with a wrapper script. Whenever Apache is requested to start/stop/restart, the
script will tell LSWS to take corresponding action. 
{ITEM=apacheBinPath} must be set to use this setting. Default is "No" for 
standard installations. For cPanel servers, the default is "Use Apache binary wrapper". 
("Override cPanel restart HTTPD script" is an optional workaround that should only 
be used if the option "Use Apache binary wrapper" is having problems.) 
For other control panels default is "Yes".

[ITEM]
ID: apachePortOffset
NAME: Apache Port Offset
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies an offset to be added to listening TCP ports specified
in the Apache configuration file. In the testing phase, this allows LiteSpeed to run alongside 
Apache on a different port instead of switching back and forth between LiteSpeed and Apache 
on a production server. 

If set to {val}0{/} or not set, LiteSpeed will use the ports specified in the Apache configuration file. 
When testing, make this setting a non-zero value. LiteSpeed will then add this offset value to 
the port specified in the Apache configuration and use this port.
After confirming that everything works properly, you can stop
Apache, set this option back to {val}0{/}, and restart LiteSpeed.

ID: apacheIpOffset
NAME: Apache IP Offset
REQUIRED:

DESCR: Specifies an offset to be added to listening IP address specified
in the Apache configuration file. This allows LiteSpeed to run alongside
Apache in the testing phase instead of switching back and forth between LiteSpeed and Apache
on a production server. The calculated IP address has to be available on this server. 

END_DESCR

SYNTAX: The offset should be set as an integer (allow negative number), not an IP address. 
Adding "256" will add 1 to the value of the C class subnet. This option
only works with IPv4 address.

ID: apacheHandledContent
NAME: Apache Handled Content
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 2
SINCE:

DESCR: Specifies resources to be passed to and processed by 
Apache on the backend. 
This feature requires running Apache parallel to LiteSpeed on either another
IP or a different port, so either "Apache Port Offset" or "Apache IP Offset" 
should be set to a non-zero value. 


END_DESCR

SYNTAX: Resources are specified by a comma delimited list of URI, file suffixes, or regular
expressions. A URI starts with "/"; a suffix starts with ".", a regular expression starts with "exp:". 
For example: "/svn/, .shtml" lets Apache handle requests with a URI
starting with "/svn/" or ending with ".shtml". The same effect can be achieved
with the regular expression "exp:^/svn/, exp:\.shtml$".

REQUIRED:

script handler. Suffixes must be unique. 

END_DESCR

SYNTAX: Comma delimited list with period "." character prohibited.
END_SYNTAX

EXAMPLE: 
END_EXAMPLE

TIPS: The server will automatically add a special MIME type ("application/x-httpd-[suffix]") for the first 
suffix in the list. For example, MIME type "application/x-httpd-php53" will be added 
for suffix "php53". Suffixes after the first need to set up in the {ITEM=mime} settings.<br>
Though we list suffixes in this field, the script handlers use MIME types, not suffixes, 
to decide which scripts to handle. You can thus use the Apache configuration directives 
"AddType" and "ForceType" (which control file MIME types) in .htaccess files to change 
which script handler certain files will use. For example, with the directive 
{cmd} AddType application/x-httpd-php53 .php{/} in a properly placed .htaccess file, 
you can stipulate that php files in this directory have the MIME type "application/x-httpd-php53" and 
thus will be handled by the script handler that uses MIME type "application/x-httpd-php53" 
(suffix "php53"). This then allows you to assign different script handlers, not only for 
different file suffixes, but also based on the locations of files.<br>
 
[Performance & Security] Only specify the suffixes you really need.

	used. </li>
	<li>When {val}None{/} is checked, access control files will be
	ignored.
	</li>
	<li>When {val}Limit{/} is checked, directives "Order",
	"Allow from" and "Deny from" are allowed. </li>
	<li>When {val}Auth{/} is checked, directives
	"AuthGroupFile",  "AuthName", "AuthType", 
	"AuthUserFile", and "Require" are allowed.</li>
	<li>When {val}FileInfo{/} is checked, directives
	"Satisfy", AddDefaultCharset", "AddType",
	"DefaultType", "ForceType", "ExpiresActive", "ExpiresDefault",
	"ExpiresByType", "Redirect", "RedirectTemp", "RedirectPermanent",
	"RewriteEngine", "RewriteOptions", "RewriteBase", "RewriteCond"
	and "RewriteRule" are allowed</li>
	<li>When {val}Indexes{/} is checked, directive
	"DirectoryIndex" is allowed</li>
	<li>When {val}Options{/} is checked, directive
	"Options" is allowed</li>
</ul>

Allow Override configuration is available at three levels: server, 
virtual host and context. If a configuration is not checked at the server level, 
the controlled directives will be disabled for the whole server whether or not 
it is enabled at lower levels. If something is enabled at the server level, virtual hosts will 
inherit same settings by default. Similarly context level settings will be inherited from virtual host settings. 
Lower levels can disable a setting that is enabled at an upper level, but cannot 
enable a setting that is disabled at an upper level.
