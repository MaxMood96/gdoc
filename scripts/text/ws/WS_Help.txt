NAME: SSL Private Key & Certificate

DESCR: Every SSL listener requires a paired SSL private key and SSL certificate. 
Multiple SSL listeners can share the same key and certificate. 


You can generate SSL private keys yourself using an SSL software package, 
such as OpenSSL. SSL certificates can also be purchased from an authorized certificate 
issuer like VeriSign or Thawte. You can also sign the certificate yourself. 
That certificate will not be trusted by web browsers and should not be used on public web 
sites containing critical data. However, a self-signed certificate is good 
enough for internal use, e.g. for encrypting traffic to LiteSpeed Web Server's WebAdmin console.
