DESCR: Specifies whether you want the web server to start the
application automatically. Only FastCGI and LSAPI applications
running on the same machine can be started automatically. The IP in the
{ITEM=extAppAddress} must be a local IP. Starting through the LiteSpeed 
CGI Daemon instead of a main server process will help reduce system overhead.  
CGI Daemon Async mode (non-blocking event-driven method) is recommended for servers with high I/O wait.
