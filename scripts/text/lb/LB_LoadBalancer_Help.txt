DESCR: Specifies the type of cluster. "Layer-7" HTTP load balancing is
supported in 1.0 release, "Layer-4" load balancing is execpted in 2.0
release. <br>
<ul>
<li>"Layer-7" HTTP load balancing is also known as application-level load
balancing, is to parse HTTP requests and distribute requests to
servers based on different types of request contents. <br>
<li>"Layer-4" load balancing is transport layer load balancing, such as
TCP and UDP transport protocol. It does not look at the content
when select a backend server. In theory, it support all kinds of
applications.
