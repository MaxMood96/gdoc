ID: accessLog_pipedLogger
NAME: Piped Logger 
REQUIRED: 
APPLY: 3
SINCE: 
SEE_ALSO: 

DESCR: Specifies an external application that will receive the access log
data sent by LiteSpeed through a pipe on its STDIN stream (file
handle 0). When specified, access log will be sent only to the logger application but not the
access log file specified in previous entry. <br>
The LiteSpeed load balancer 
performs simple load balancing among multiple logger applications if
more than one instance of logger application is configured. 
LiteSpeed server always attempts
to keep the number of logger processes as low as possible. Only when 
one logger application failed to process access log entries in time 
will the server attempt to spawn another instance of logger
application. <br>
If a logger process crashes, the server will start another instance but
the log data in the stream buffer will be lost. It is possible to lose
log data if external loggers cannot keep up  
with the speed and volume of the log stream. <br>
File path to the logger application should be given here, and
optionally, number of application instaces can be set before the file
path, followed by '|'. Example, "4|/path/to/logger/app" tell server to
start up to 4 logger processes, while, only one logger process will be
started if "/path/to/logger/app" is used.

NAME: External Application

DESCR: LiteSpeed load balancer supports 5 types of external
applications: FastCGI, Web Server, Servlet Engine, LSAPI
Application and Piped Logger. Unlike LiteSpeed web server, all the
external applications cannot be started by the load balancer.<br>
<ul>
<li>FastCGI is a fast, open, and secure web server interface that solves the 
  performance problems inherent from CGI without introducing the overhead and 
  complexity of proprietary APIs (Application Programming
  Interfaces).  For more information, please visit 
  {ext-href}http://www.fastcgi.com{ext-href-end}http://www.fastcgi.com{ext-href-end-a}<br> 
  In addition to generating dynamic
  response (RESPONDER role), a FastCGI application can be used for
  authentication (AUTHORIZER role) as well.
<br><br></li>
<li>Web Server is a server application that supports HTTP 1.0/1.1
protocols. When communicating with backend web servers, LiteSpeed load
balancer will always try to utilize "persistent connection" in order to achieve
highest performance.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Servlet Engine is an application that implements Java Servlet and
Java Server Pages like Apache Tomcat and Jetty. LiteSpeed load balancer can communicate
with Servlet engine through AJPv1.3 (Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3).
<br><br></li>
<li>LSAPI (LiteSpeed Server API) Application is an application that communicates with
LiteSpeed Web Server through LSAPI which is a fast, scalable server interface
specfically designed for LiteSpeed Web Server to achieve maximum efficiency. <br>
LSAPI is similar to FastCGI but LSAPI application can be up to 15%
faster than a comparable FastCGI application.
For most demanding web applicatin, LSAPI is highly 
recommended over FastCGI.<br>
Our tests shows that LSAPI PHP, PHP compiled with LiteSpeed SAPI, is 
up to 30% faster than FastCGI PHP. 
For more information about LSAPI and PHP please visit
{ext-href}http://www.litespeedtech.com/lsapi/{ext-href-end}http://www.litespeedtech.com/lsapi/{ext-href-end-a}.
<br><br></li>

<li>Piped Logger is an application that can process access
log in real-time, for examples, writing access log into database, performing
real-time statistics calculation, etc.
<br><br></li>

</ul>
External applications will be used as a handler of a specific context in LiteSpeed load balancer: 

<br>
External Applications can be configured at server or virtual host level. 
When configured at server level, it can be used by all virtual hosts. When configured at 
virtual host level, it can only be used within the virtual host.

document root of a web site; "/cgi-bin/" is Context dedicated to CGI applications. 
If you think your web site as a URL tree, then every branch is a context which can be 
identified by the URL of the branching node. A context should be explicitly defined for the 
following purposes:
<ul>
  <li>To use another cluster other than the default one.</li>
  <li>To redirect requests to another location.</li>

DESCR: Every SSL listener requires a paired SSL private key and SSL certificate. 
Multiple SSL listeners can share the same key and certificate. 
You can generate SSL private keys yourself using an SSL software package, 
such as OpenSSL. SSL certificates can also be purchased from an authorized certificate 
issuer like VeriSign or Thawte. You can also sign the certificate yourself. 
That certificate will not be trusted by web browsers and should not be used on public web 
sites containing critical data. However, a self-signed certificate is good 
enough for internal use, e.g. for encrypting traffic 
to LiteSpeed Web Server's WebAdmin console.

PREV_NAV: Listeners_Help

TOP_NAV: config.html = Configuration

DESCR: Virtual host template can be used to simplify the
administration of virtual hosts with similar configuration,
especially, for mass hosting environment. Once a template is configured
properly, only minimum configuration is required when adding a new virtual
host. <br>
Each template contains a template configuration file, a list of mapped listeners
and a list of member virtual hosts. <br>
<br>
The template configuration file
contains all configuration entries for a virtual host, with some
fields requiring special values. <br>
<br>
To add a template-based virtual host, administrator only needs to
add a member to the template member list with a unique virtual host name and a
qualified domain name of that virtual host.
Lister-to-virtual host mapping will be added automatically for 
all listeners in the mapped listener list. <br>
<br>
Later on, if you need to customize the configuration for a particular
virtual host, just "instantiate" that member virtual host, a
standalone virtual host configuration will be created automatically.
Even when setting up a virtual host with different configuration,
it is still convenient to use a template as a starting point, and then customize it after instantiation.
