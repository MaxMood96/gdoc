<p class="label-title">Security</p>

LiteSpeed Load Balancer is designed with security as top consideration in mind.<br>
It supports <span class="tag">SSL</span>; has <span class="tag">Access Control</span> at server and virtual host level. Besides those standard features, it also has the following special security features. <br>
<ol>
  <li><span class="label1">Connection level limits:</span></li>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li> IP level throttling: Limits network bandwidth to and from a single IP 
      address regardless of the number of connections. </li>
    <li> IP level connection accounting: Limits the number of concurrent connections 
      from a single IP address. It is controlled by <span class="tag">Connection 
      Soft Limit</span>, <span class="tag">Connection Hard Limit</span>, <span class="tag">Grace 
      Period</span> and <span class="tag">Banned Period</span>. </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <li><span class="label1">Request checking:</span></li>
  <p> Every HTTP request is strictly checked by LiteSpeed load balancer.<br>
    "/." is not allowed in a decoded URL, this will deny accessing hidden files 
    and parent directories. <br>
    Request size is limited by <span class="tag">Max Request URL Length</span>, 
    <span class="tag">Max Request Header Length</span> and <span class="tag">Max 
    Request Body Length</span>. </p>

  <li><span class="label1">Request filtering:</span></li>
  <p> Request header and body can be checked against signatures of possible attacks
     like XSS attack or SQL injection attackes, and block those requests in the first place. 
  </p>

  <li><span class="label1">Backend overloading prevention:</span></li>
  <p>LiteSpeed load balancer can pipeline requests and control the concurrent level 
    to an external applications to prevent overloading backend servers. 
    It caches the response from web server, thus backend server will be immediately available to process 
    next request without waiting for the response completely received by the client. 
    In this way, backend server can serve more concurrent requests and will achieve 
	higher performance and scalability. 
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <li><span class="label1">Chroot</span></li>
  <p> LiteSpeed load balancer can run in chroot environment (known as a chroot jail). 
    In chroot environment, the server and its children processes cannot access 
    file system outside of the chroot jail. This protects system from attacks 
    of malicious code. </p>
