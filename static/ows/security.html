<p class="label-title">Security</p>

LiteSpeed Web Server is designed with security as a top consideration. 
LSWS supports SSL, has access control at server and virtual host levels, 
and context-specific realm protection. Besides these standard features, 
LSWS also has the following special security features: <br>
<ol>
  <li><span class="label1">Connection level limits:</span></li>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li> IP-level throttling limits network bandwidth to and from a single IP 
      address regardless of the number of connections. </li>
    <li> IP-level connection accounting limits the number of concurrent connections 
      from a single IP address. You can controll this with the connection 
      soft limit, connection hard limit, grace 
      period, and banned period settings in the WebAdmin console. </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <li><span class="label1">Request checking:</span></li>
  <p> Every HTTP request is vetted by LiteSpeed Web Server. "/." is not allowed in
    a decoded URL, thus denying accessing hidden files and parent directories.<br> 
    Request size is limited 
    by LiteSpeed Web Server's max request URL length, 
    max request header length, and max 
    request body length settings. </p>
 
  <li> <span class="label1">Static file checking:</span></li>
  <p> LiteSpeed Web Server will serve a static file only if the following conditions 
    are satisfied: 
  <ul>
    <li>The file is readable by everyone.</li>
    <li>The file is not executable.</li>
    <li>The file is not in the access denied directory list.</li>
    <li> The file does not contain symbolic link if symbolic links are not allowed. </li>
    <li>By default, LiteSpeed Web Server does not index a directory by listing its
        files, it has to be enabled explicitly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>

  <li><span class="label1">External application firewall:</span></li>
<p> LiteSpeed Web Server forwards requests to external applications to 
  process/generate dynamic content. Those applications can use a lot of 
  system resources. The performance of the whole system will be severely
  degraded when system resource consumption reaches a certain 
    point -- when swapping space has to be used, for example.  
    One way to conduct a DoS attack is to flood the web server with 
  concurrent requests to a cumbersome external application. </p>

  <p>LiteSpeed Web Server can pipeline requests and control the concurrent level 
    of external application use to prevent overconsumption of system resources. 
    LSWS caches requests and only forwards completed requests to the external 
  application. This means the external application will not be 
    held waiting while the server is receiving the request. LSWS also caches 
 the external application's response so that the external application 
 can be released as soon as the response is completed and does not have 
 to wait for the client to receive the complete response. 
    This way the server can utilize fewer external application instances
    to serve more concurrent requests and achieve higher performance and 
    scalability. LiteSpeed Web Server also uses its own virtual memory to cache 
    the request and response body to minimize the usage of system memory without 
    sacrificing performance. </p>
  <p></p>

  <li><span class="label1">CGI resources consumption limit:</span></li>

  <p> LiteSpeed Web Server restricts the amount of system resources that can be consumed by 
    CGI applications. For each request to a CGI script, the web server needs to 
    start a standalone CGI process to handle it. On a Unix system, the number of concurrent 
    processes is limited. With the CGI resources consumption limit, you can configure 
   the maximum number of concurrent CGI instances that the web server can launch.  
   Excessive concurrent processes will degrade the performance 
    of the whole system. (CGI processes are a common weapon for DoS attacks.)
    A system process limit can be specified per user in order to control the number
    of processes that can be spawned by a CGI application. 
    Each process is further confined by CPU and memory limits.</p>
 
  <li><span class="label1">Enhanced CGI/FastCGI security with suEXEC and chroot:</span></li>
  <p>In order to reduce the security risks of a CGI or Fast CGI script, LiteSpeed Web Server 
     can restrict the system resources the CGI script can access by running it in "suEXEC" 
     or "chroot jail" mode. "suEXEC" starts the CGI or Fast CGI script with a different 
     user ID from that of the web server. This greatly improves security in
     shared hosting environment 
     by preventing one user's CGI script from accessing other users' files.<br>
     "chroot jail" starts the CGI script under an assigned alternative
     root directory. The script can not access files beyond the new root directory. 
     With this, you no longer need to worry about confidential system files being 
     exposed by vulnerable scripts.
